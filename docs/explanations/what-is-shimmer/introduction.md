# What is Shimmer?

[Shimmer](https://shimmer.network/) is an innovation network where the community tries out the new protocol changes
before they are deployed on the more conservative [IOTA network](https://wiki.iota.org/introduction/welcome/). It has
its own supply of tokens which are called [$SMR](tokens-and-wallets.md).

The Shimmer network uses the new [Stardust protocol](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/welcome/) that upgrades
the current [Chrysalis](https://wiki.iota.org/introduction/welcome/) protocol by introducing computation and utility to
the ledger by introducing several new features.

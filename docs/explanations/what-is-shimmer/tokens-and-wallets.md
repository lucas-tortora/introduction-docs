# Tokens and Wallets

As Shimmer supports [ISC(IOTA Smart Contracts)](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/smart-contracts/overview/), the base token
is used for more than speculation. Since ISC is built on top of
the [Tangle](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/learn/tangle/), it uses the Tangle to anchor state updates,
operate between chains, mint Native Assets, and access the network. However, there is another major use for the base token in the Shimmer network.

## Storage Deposits

With the introduction
of [storage deposits](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/explanations/what_is_stardust/storage_deposit/), any
data you want to store on the Tangle needs to be backed by Shimmer tokens. NFTs, Smart Contract chain state anchors, and Native Assets
require a deposit of Shimmer tokens to be stored on L1.

:::tip Test Faucet

If you are experimenting with Shimmer on the [testnet](networks.md#public-testnet), you can request test funds from
the [Faucet](networks.md#the-faucet).

## Buying Shimmer

You can find up-to-date instructions on how to buy `SMR` in
the [Buying Shimmer section](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/learn/token/buying/) of this wiki.

## Wallets

A wallet is a tool to access, transfer and manipulate your tokens on the Shimmer network. It gives you a convenient
solution to store your secret keys and use them in the network to control your tokens.

It is important that you understand that your tokens are not actually stored in the wallet; they are stored in
the [Tangle](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/learn/tangle/). The wallet knows your seed's private
and public keys, so it can access the addresses of all your
tokens on the Shimmer network and has full control over all ledger functions.

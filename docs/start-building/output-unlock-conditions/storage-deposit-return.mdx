# Storage Deposit Returns in Transfers

Stardust introduces a new system to protect the ledger size and hence node storage resources, called Byte-cost based
Storage Deposit System. You can read more about it in [TIP-19](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/tips/TIP-0019/tip-0019.md).
In short, every output in the ledger need to carry enough base tokens to cover for its network storage use.

Implicitly this means that an output has to have a minimum amount of base tokens, otherwise it is considered invalid.
The exact minimum depends on the size of the output and the protocol parameter _Virtual Byte Cost_. The implication of
this is that is no longer possible to store microfunds in an output. So suppose you wanted to send 1i (0.000001 MIOTA):
is it still possible?

The answer is yes. With the [Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#storage-deposit-return-unlock-condition)
it is possible to define spending constraints on outputs that you create. Let's assume that the minimum amount of funds
that need to be present in an output is 100i. If you wanted to send only 1i to the recipient, you should transfer
101i to the recipient's address with the extra condition that recipient can only use the funds if the recipient refunds
you in the very same transaction with 100i.

## Example Transactions

### Send a Micro-transaction

Transaction G show the creation of an output with _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_. Notice, that _Basic Output #11_
holds 101i, and the unlock condition defines the _Return Amount_ of 100i to _ReturnAddress_ _ownerAddress_. All in all,
the recipient can only freely use 1i when recipient consumes the output in Transaction H.

### Receive a Micro-transaction

In order for the recipient to claim the 1i, the recipient needs to sweep it into one of their own outputs. Therefore,
the recipient consumes _Basic Output #12_ in the transaction that holds the funds. On the output side, the recipient has
to have _Basic Output #13_ that refunds the original sender, and create _Basic Output #14_ that sweeps the 1i.

What forces the recipient to post and execute Transaction H? Nothing. The recipient can just keep the sender's 100i in
limbo forever. That is why it is handy that you can combine unlock conditions. For example, the sender can add an [expiration
condition](expiration.mdx) to _Basic Output #11_. Once the output is expired, the recipient won't be able to claim the
1i and the sender takes full custody of the 101i in the output.

# Transfer an NFT

## Transfer Without Storage Deposit Return

When an NFT is sold via a marketplace, it is the platform that decides how to handle the storage deposit, whether the buying
price accounts for it or the owner should be refunded by the recipient via a _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_.

### Example Transaction

Transaction B sends the newly issued _NFT Output #1_ to the _recipient_:
- Since it has just been minted in Transaction A, The _NFT ID_ is all zeros in _NFT Output #1_. While the value of the
field ([explicit NFT ID](https://github.com/lzpap/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#additional-transaction-semantic-validation-rules-3))
is all zeroes, based on the protocol rules we know that the [implicit NFT ID](https://github.com/lzpap/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#additional-transaction-semantic-validation-rules-3)
can be calculated from the _Output ID_ of _NFT Output #1_.
- When the minted NFT is transferred for the first time, the _NFT ID_ must be set as the implicit NFT ID of the mint
output. Therefore, _NFT Output #2_ sets the value of the _NFT ID_ field as the blake2b-256 hash of _NFT Output #1 ID_.
**If you miss this step and leave it as all zeroes, the protocol interprets the transaction as the
[burning of the minted NFT](burn.mdx) and the creation of a new NFT.**
- Notice that the immutable features are not allowed to change. Their values are carried together with the NFT until
it is burned.
- To change ownership of the NFT, unlock the address of the _Address Unlock Condition_ (_owner_) in the transaction and
set a new owner (_recipient_) on the output side.
- Without further unlock conditions, the _owner_ loses the 100i storage deposit which is now controlled by _recipient_.

### Why Can't the NFT ID be Set Directly Upon Minting?

It was shown in Transaction A that _NFT ID_ must be zeroed out on minting, and via Transaction B that it has to be set to
the protocol generated value in the first transfer. The reason for this is the chicken and egg situation rooted in how
unique values are generated on protocol level:

A unique _NFT ID_ is computed from _Output ID_, that is computed from the minting transaction content. The transaction
content contains the value of the _NFT ID_ field of the output. On minting, the _NFT ID_ is set to zero to signal the
minting operation. As soon as the transaction is prepared (you don't even need to submit it yet) the _Output ID_ is
known. Therefore, _NFT ID_ can be computed locally, but it is not possible to place it inside the minting output, as
that would alter the transaction content, and therefore the _Output ID_ and the _NFT ID_ itself.

## Transfer an NFT With Storage Deposit Return

If you want the original owner to get the storage deposit back, you will need to add the
[_Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_](../output-unlock-conditions/storage-deposit-return.mdx), and since the deposit
won't be returned until the NFT is claimed, you may also want to add the
[_Expiration Unlock Condition_](../output-unlock-conditions/expiration.mdx).


### Example Transaction

Transaction C shows a conditional transfer of an NFT. By defining a _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_ and an
_Expiration Unlock Condition_, the recipient has to claim the NFT transfer in a transaction that:
 - Refunds the storage deposit to the _owner_ address,
 - within the timeframe specified in the expiration condition.

If the recipient fails to claim the transfer in time, the ownership of _NFT Output #3_ falls back to the _owner_
address defined in the _Expiration Unlock Condition_. An expired output can be unlocked by this address without having
to fulfill the _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_.

Transaction C defines that _recipient_ has to claim the output in a transaction such that:
 - _owner_ is refunded with 100i via a _Basic Output_,
 - the claiming transaction may only be carried out until _May 24 2022 18:00:00_.

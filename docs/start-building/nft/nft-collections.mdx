# NFT Collections

NFTs rarely exist in isolation, usually they are part of a bigger set, a collection. In smart contract based NFTs like ERC1155, a
collection and the NFTs in it are all tracked in a single contract. In UTXO based systems like IOTA/Shimmer however this
is not possible, so a new way of linking together NFTs is needed.

Stardust protocol allows linking NFTs together via the _Issuer Feature_. Since NFTs are first class citizens in the protocol,
they can function as issuers themselves. This feature is exploited for L1 NFT collections.

## Creation of a Collection NFT

A Collection NFT is a just a normal _NFT Output_ but with special purpose: it is used to mint all NFTs in the collection.
The Collection NFT becomes the _Issuer_ of the _NFT Outputs_ representing NFTs within the collection.

It is possible to:
 - Permanently lock the Collection NFT to prevent any future minting. No diluting is ever possible by issuers.
 - Lock the Collection NFT for some time to prevent minting,
 - Deposit the Collection NFT into a L2 chain where minting activity can be governed via smart contracts or DAOs.

Transaction H mints a Collection NFT the same way as Transaction A mints a regular one. The metadata makes it clear
that the intended use of this NFT is to serve as a Collection NFT.
 - _name_ defines the name of the collection,
 - _uri_ points to a website with more information about the project. Note, that _type_ defines the resource type for _uri_.

## Minting NFTs Within the Collection

NFTs within the collection must be minted in a way that their _issuer_ is the Collection NFT. Therefore, we include
_NFT Output #10_, the freshly minted Collection NFT from Transaction H in Transaction J, and define the _Issuer Feature_
of all minted NFTs to hold the _NFT Address_ of the Collection NFT.

We also place unique metadata in each NFT within the collection. The metadata is formatted according to IRC27 and contains
information about:
 - where the asset represented by the NFT resides,
 - the issuer or artist,
 - the collection the NFT belongs to,
 - optional royalty addresses,
 - and custom attributes.

Transaction J mints a very limited collection, there are only 3 items _NFT Output #12, #13 and #14_. The issuer must
also provide the storage deposit for the newly minted NFTs, therefore _Basic Output #7_ is consumed in the transaction.

:::note
If you need to mint more than _Max Outputs Count_ ([TIP-22](https://github.com/Wollac/protocol-rfcs/blob/protocol-parameters/tips/TIP-0022/tip-0022.md#detailed-design) IOTA, [TIP-32](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/shimmer-params/tips/TIP-0032/tip-0032.md#global-parameters) Shimmer) NFTs, you must do it via chaining together more transactions.
:::

Once the minting transaction confirms, it is possible to fetch all NFT outputs within the collection via the [Indexer API TIP-26](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/indexer-api/tips/TIP-0026/tip-0026.md). The following query returns all NFT outputs (their _Output IDs_)
that have been issued by the Collection NFT:

```
GET <indexer-base-url>/api/indexer/v1/outputs/nft?issuer=<collection-nft-address>
```

## Lock Collection NFT

The best way to ensure scarcity of collections is to prevent future minting activity. It is possible to lock the
Collection NFT in the ledger for some time via a _Timelock Unlock Condition_, or for eternity by sending it to the zero address.

The zero address is an Ed25519 address where the hash of the Ed255129 public key is all zeroes, therefore there exists no
private key that could successfully unlock it.

# Create an Alias

Just like a _Basic Output_, an _Alias Output_ also must have:
 - __Amount__ to hold base token.
 - __Unlock Conditions__ that define how the output can be unlocked.
 - __Features__ that don't modify the unlocking.

On top of these, it also defines:

 - __State Index__ that has to be incremented in every transaction initiated by the _State Controller_.
 - __State Metadata__ that may hold binary data.
 - __Foundry Counter__ that defines how many foundries the alias has created.
 - __Immutable Features__ that are regular _Features_ defined upon creation which can never be modified afterward.

## Available Unlock Conditions

Alias outputs only support two type of unlock conditions:

 - __State Controller Address Unlock Condition__ that defines the state controller.
 - __Governor Address Unlock Condition__ that defines the governor of the alias.

## Example Transaction

Transaction A shows the process of creating a new alias output and hence an alias account. Notice the creation
constraints enforced by the protocol:

 - __Alias ID__ must be zeroed out. This signals to the protocol that the alias account is new and when the transaction
confirms, a unique __Alias ID__ must be generated.
 - __State Index__ must be zero as this is the first possible state the alias represents.
 - __Foundry Counter__ must be zero as the alias doesn't control any foundries yet.
 - __Issuer__ and __Sender__ addresses must be unlocked in the transaction if present.

When _Alias Output #1_ from Transaction A is consumed in a subsequent transaction, the _Alias ID_ field in the
transitioned alias must be set to the protocol generated unique identifier, which is the Blake2b-256 hash of the
_Output ID_ of _Alias Output #1_.

# Unlock Funds Owned by an Alias

An alias account may own funds in the ledger two ways:
- Locked directly in its alias output.
- Locked in other outputs to the address of the alias.

The global alias address is derived from the unique _Alias ID_. Technically, the alias address is the concatenation of
the _Alias Address Type_ and the _Alias ID_. A practical example from
[TIP-31](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/add-smr-hrps/tips/TIP-0031/tip-0031.md):

 - _Output ID_ (34-byte) that created the alias: `52fdfc072182654f163f5f0f9a621d729566c74d10037c4d7bbb0407d1e2c6490000`
 - _Alias ID_, BLAKE2b-256 hash (32-byte): `fe80c2eb7c736da2f7c98ecf135ee9e34e4e076afe6e1dfebc9ec578b8f56d2f`
 - Serialized alias address (33-byte): `08fe80c2eb7c736da2f7c98ecf135ee9e34e4e076afe6e1dfebc9ec578b8f56d2f`
 - Bech32 string:
 - IOTA (64-char): `iota1prlgpsht03ekmghhex8v7y67a835uns8dtlxu807hj0v279c74kj76j6rev`
 - IOTA Testnet (64-char): `atoi1prlgpsht03ekmghhex8v7y67a835uns8dtlxu807hj0v279c74kj7autzrp`
 - Shimmer (63-char): `smr1prlgpsht03ekmghhex8v7y67a835uns8dtlxu807hj0v279c74kj7dzrr0a`
 - Shimmer Testnet (63-char): `rms1prlgpsht03ekmghhex8v7y67a835uns8dtlxu807hj0v279c74kj7e9ge5y`

Anyone can send funds in the ledger to the address of the alias, while only the current state controller is able to
unlock those funds by including the alias itself in the very same transaction. An alias address doesn't have
a private key for signing unlocks, therefore one has to prove that they can unlock the alias output that created the
alias address.

## Example Transaction

Transaction E shows the process of alias unlocking. _Basic Output #3_ holds funds that are locked to the address of the
alias. The state controller initiates a state transition and includes the basic output in the same transaction.
The _Unlock_ for _Basic Output #3_ is an _Alias Unlock_ that references the _Unlock_ of the alias that defines
_aliasAddress_.

You should note that an _Alias Unlock_ may only reference an unlock at a lower index within the transaction to
prevent circular unlocking without any signature. Due to this reason, it is possible to intentionally deadlock aliases
by locking them to each other's alias address. Clients should implement safety mechanisms to prevent accidental user errors.

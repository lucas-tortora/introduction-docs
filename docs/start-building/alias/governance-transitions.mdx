# Governance Transitions

Transaction C depicts a governance transition of the alias. Such a transaction must be signed by the address in
_Governor Address Unlock Condition_.

A valid governance can do the following:

 - The alias output may be destroyed by the governor (see Transaction D in [Destroy an Alias](destroy.mdx)).
 - The _State Controller Address Unlock Condition_ may be changed.
 - The _Governor Address Unlock Condition_ may be changed.
 - The _Metadata Feature_ may be changed.

No other fields are allowed to change in the next alias state, therefore **a governance transition can't modify token
balances or create foundries**.

# State Transitions

As the name suggests, a state transition must be initiated by the _State Controller_, therefore it is the
_stateControllerAddress_ that needs to sign the transaction.

## Example Transaction

Transaction B represents a state transition of the alias. During a state transition, the following must happen:

- The alias can't be destroyed.
- The _State Index_ must be incremented.
- The _Foundry Counter_ must be incremented by the number of foundries created in the transaction.
- The _Unlock Conditions_ must not be changed, therefore the state controller can't update ownership of the alias account.
- The _Metadata Feature_ must not be updated.

The following can happen, but is optional:

- Token balances of the output may be changed, the _State Controller_ can transfer funds in- and out of the alias account.
- The _State Metadata_ may be updated,
- The _Sender Feature_ may be updated,

Notice how the _Alias ID_ field has to be set in _Alias Output #2_ to the protocol generated value.

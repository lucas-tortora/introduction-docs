# Mint Tokens

Now that we have the foundry, it's time to mint native tokens. We simply need to transition the foundry in a transaction,
declare that we mint tokens and place them in an output of our choice.

Tokens controlled by a foundry have a globally unique identifier, called _Token ID_, that is derived from the properties
of the foundry. To get the _Token ID_, one has to concatenate:
 - the serialized _Alias Address_ that controls the foundry (33 bytes),
 - the _Serial Number_ of the foundry,
 - and the _Token Scheme Type_.

By knowing the _Token ID_, one can fetch current unspent foundry output from the Indexer API defined in [TIP-26](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/indexer-api/tips/TIP-0026/tip-0026.md).

Transaction B mints all available tokens in the foundry.
 - _Minted Tokens_ in _Foundry Output #2_ is increased by the number of minted tokens, namely 1000.
 - 500 tokens are minted into _Basic Output #1_ and locked to _mintAddress_.
 - 500 tokens are minted into _Basic Output #2_ and locked to _vestAddress_. Additionally, a timelock is specified on
the output so that these token can only be unlocked after May 24 2023 18:00:00.

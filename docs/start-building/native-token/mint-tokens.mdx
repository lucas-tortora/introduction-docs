# Mint Tokens

Once you have [created a foundry](create-foundry.mdx), you can mint native tokens. You only need to transition the
foundry in a transaction, declare that you mint tokens and place them in an output of our choice.

Tokens controlled by a foundry have a globally unique identifier called _Token ID_ that is derived from the properties
of the foundry. To get the _Token ID_, you have to concatenate:
- The serialized _Alias Address_ that controls the foundry (33 bytes).
- The _Serial Number_ of the foundry.
- The _Token Scheme Type_.

By knowing the _Token ID_, you can fetch current unspent foundry outputs from the Indexer API defined in
[TIP-26](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/indexer-api/tips/TIP-0026/tip-0026.md).

## Example Transaction

Transaction B mints all the available tokens in the foundry.
 - _Minted Tokens_ in _Foundry Output #2_ is increased by the number of minted tokens, namely 1000.
 - 500 tokens are minted into _Basic Output #1_ and locked to _mintAddress_.
 - 500 tokens are minted into _Basic Output #2_ and locked to _vestAddress_. Additionally, a timelock is specified on
the output so that these token can only be unlocked after May 24 2023 18:00:00.

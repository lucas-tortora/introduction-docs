# Transfer Native Tokens with Storage Deposit

Transferring native tokens is similar to transferring base tokens. The output that you create on the receiver's address
however needs to have base tokens to cover for the storage deposit. Therefore, there are two ways to transfer native tokens:

- Sending native tokens together with the required storage deposit. The sender loses access to the storage deposit in
this case, as shown in transaction E.
- Sending native tokens using the _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_. The receiver has to claim the transfer by
refunding the sender's storage deposit. The sender doesn't lose the storage deposit this case, as shown in transaction F.


## Example Transactions

### Conditional Transfer of Native Tokens

#### Add the unlock conditions

In order not to lose access to the storage deposit, two additional unlock conditions are defined on
_Basic Output #7_ in Transaction F:

 - A [_Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_](../output-unlock-conditions/storage-deposit-return.mdx) that forces the
consumer of the output to refund _Return Amount_ of base tokens to _Return Address_.
 - An [_Expiration Unlock Condition_](../output-unlock-conditions/expiration.mdx) that defines a time window
the recipient has to claim the transfer. If they don't do so, ownership of _Basic Output #7_ bounces back to the sender
and the _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_ is ignored.
 - The expiration time is compared to the timestamp of the confirming milestone to decide whether the unlock is valid or not.

Transaction F shows the creation of a conditional transfer:

#### Claim the transfer

Once the transaction is created, the recipient can claim the transfer before the expiration deadline. Transaction G shows
a successful claiming. Note that:

- The recipient needs to sweep the native tokens into an output they already own to cover for the storage deposit, hence
_Basic Output #8_ is unlocked in the transaction.
- _Basic Output #9_ refunds the sender with the storage deposit used to create _Basic Output #7_.

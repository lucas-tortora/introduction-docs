# Burn tokens

Burning tokens by token holders without the involvement of the foundry is possible to prevent losing access to the
storage deposit of the underlying tokens. What would happen if _mintAddress_ in _Basic Output #3_ is not controlled by the
issuer, but some other entity?

They obviously can't melt the tokens without controlling the foundry, therefore they can't free up the base tokens
(IOTA/SMR) in _Basic Output #3_. Unless the issuer buys back the tokens or someone else relieves the user by taking the
tokens and refunding the storage deposit, it is locked forever. Burning native tokens allows you to discard them and
free up the storage deposit.

:::warning

Burnt tokens are no longer tracked in the ledger, therefore burning is conceptually equivalent to sending to the zero address
without a storage deposit.

## Example Transaction

Transaction D burns all tokens in _Basic Output #3_. Notice that _mintAddress_ doesn't have to have the approval of the
foundry and the controlling alias account.

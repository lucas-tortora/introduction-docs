# Sender

Next to _Unlock Conditions_, Stardust allows to define optional _Features_ on outputs of a transfer that do not impact
the actual unlocking of the created output.  The _Sender_ feature is one of such features, which lets the creator of the output
define an explicit _Sender Address_ attribute for an output.

The _Sender_ attribute is validated on protocol level. Validation ensures that the transaction that created the output
unlocked the _Sender_ address on the input side. Therefore, this feature is a protocol validated proof that the output
was created by someone who controls the _Sender_ address.

Transaction J shows how one can add a sender attribute to a created output. Note, that Transaction J would be invalid
if:
 - _Basic Output #15_ wouldn't be locked to _senderAddress_, or
 - _Basic Output #16_ would define _Sender_ as anything else than _senderAddress_ from _Basic Output #15_.

On-ledger (originating from L1) requests of IOTA Smart Contracts use this feature heavily, but it is also possible to
fetch outputs created by a specific party with the _Sender Feature_ through the [INX UTXO indexer application](https://github.com/gohornet/inx-indexer)
and [REST API](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/indexer-api/tips/TIP-0026/tip-0026.md).

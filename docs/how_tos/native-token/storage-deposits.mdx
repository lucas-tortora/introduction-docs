# Transfer Native Tokens with Storage Deposit

Transferring native tokens is similar to transferring base tokens. The output that you create on the receiver's address
however needs to have base tokens to cover for the storage deposit. Therefore, there are two ways to transfer native tokens:
 - Sending native tokens together with the required storage deposit. The sender loses access to the storage deposit.
 - Sending native tokens with _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_. The receiver has to claim the transfer by refunding
the storage deposit of the sender. The sender doesn't lose the storage deposit.

The former method is depicted in Transaction E. Due to claiming in the latter method, it is called a conditional transfer, depicted in Transaction F.

## Conditional transfer of native tokens

In order not to lose access to the storage deposit, two additional unlock conditions are defined on
_Basic Output #7_ in Transaction F:
 - A _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_ that forces the consumer of the output to refund _Return Amount_ of base tokens to _Return Address_,
 - and an _Expiration Unlock Condition_ that defines a time window until the recipient has to claim the transfer. If they don't do so,
ownership of _Basic Output #7_ bounces back to the sender and the _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_ is ignored.
 - The expiration time is compared to the timestamp of the confirming milestone to decide whether the unlock is valid or not.

Transaction F shows the creation of a conditional transfer:

Once the "offer" is created, the recipient can claim the transfer until the expiration deadline. Transaction G shows
a successful claiming.
 - Note that the recipient needs to sweep the native tokens into an output they already own to cover for the storage deposit, hence _Basic Output #8_ is unlocked in the transaction.
 - _Basic Output #9_ refunds the sender with the storage deposit used to create _Basic Output #7_.

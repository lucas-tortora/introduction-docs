# Creating a Foundry

As mentioned above, only an alias can create new foundries, therefore the process starts with an existing _Alias Output_.
To create a new foundry, simply state transition the alias and create a new _Foundry Output_ on the output side of the
transaction.

Transaction A shows an example transaction that creates a foundry:
 - The controlling alias is state transitioned, its _State Index_ and _Foundry Counter_ are incremented.
 - To cover for the storage deposit of the created _Foundry Output_, the alias deposits 100i into the output.
 - The _Serial Number_ of the foundry must correspond to the updated _Foundry Counter_. Each foundry created by the alias
is unique because of the unique _Serial Number_.
 - The foundry uses the _Simple Token Scheme_ as a supply control rule. It defines an upper cap (_Maximum Supply_) for
tokens in circulation.
 - _Minted Tokens_ defines how many tokens have been minted by the foundry. Since we don't immediately mint tokens in this
transaction, it is set to 0.
 - _Melted Tokens_ defines how many tokens have been melted by the foundry. At creation there are no tokens to be melted,
therefore this must be 0.
 - Foundries support only one unlock condition, namely the _Immutable Alias Address Unlock Condition_. It can never be changed
during the lifetime of the foundry, therefore the issuer role can only be transferred via the controlling alias.
 - Metadata about the token may be put in the _Immutable Metadata Feature_ of the foundry. For example, it may hold an
[IRC30](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/token-metadata-schema/tips/TIP-0030/tip-0030.md) compatible JSON file.
By hosting token metadata on-chain in a foundry output, we make the data available on all network nodes 24/7. There is
no need for additional, off-chain metadata servers.

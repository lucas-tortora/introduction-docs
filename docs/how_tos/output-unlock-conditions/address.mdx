# Transfer Funds to an Address

A simple transaction moves funds from one user account to another. On a high level, transactions must define 3 things:
 - **Inputs**: previously created unpsent transaction outputs holding funds that the transaction consumes,
 - **Unlock Blocks**: they hold the signatures authorizing the consumption of inputs,
 - **Outputs**: newly created outputs holding transferred funds.

In Stardust a simple transfer may be realized with an output type called [Basic Output](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#basic-output).
Just like every other output type, Basic Outputs define the base token funds they hold in the _Amount_ field. They have
to have at least one [Unlock Condition](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#unlock-conditions)
defined: the [Address Unlock Condition](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#address-unlock-condition).

It means that in order to unlock the output in a transaction, one has to present a valid signature for the given address.
The signature signs the whole content of the transaction, thereby authorizing the consumption of inputs but also
declaring the intention to create new outputs.

Transaction A simply:
 - consumes as input a _Basic Output_ with _100i_ locked under _ownerAddress_,
 - provides an _Unlock_, namely a _Signature Unlock_ that contains a valid signature of the transaction content corresponding
to the private key behind _ownerAddress_,
 - creates a new _Basic Output_ with _100i_ locked under the recipients address, namely _recipientAddress_.

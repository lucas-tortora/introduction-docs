## Transfer of Funds with Expiration

The first new _Unlock Condition_ we are going to look at is the [Expiration Unlock Condition](https://github.com/iotaledger/tips/blob/master/tips/TIP-0018/tip-0018.md#expiration-unlock-condition).
It lets the creator of the output define an _Expiration Deadline_. Before the deadline, the recipient can consume and
unlock the output in a transaction, but once the deadline expired, only the _Return Address_ defined in the
_Expiration Unlock Condition_ can unlock it.

Transaction B defines an output that can only be unlocked by the recipient in a transaction that is confirmed by a
milestone where _Milestone Unix Timestamp_ is less, than the _Unix Time_ defined in the _Expiration Unlock Condition_.

Transaction C shows how the recipient can consume the output before the deadline and take the funds into full, unconditional
custody.

Transaction D depicts how the original sender claims an expired output. Note, that it is not necessary for the sender
to sweep the funds into their own wallet, they can just treat it as funds they have full custody of.

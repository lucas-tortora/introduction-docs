# Destroy an Alias

Transaction D shows a governance transition that destroys the alias. The storage deposit is refunded to a governor
defined address. Keep in mind that once the alias is destroyed, any funds locked in the ledger in other outputs to the
address of the alias (derived from _Alias ID_) are essentially lost, as it is not possible to unlock them ever.

# Governance Transition

Transaction C depicts a governance transition of the alias. Such a transaction must be signed by the address in
_Governor Address Unlock Condition_. The constraints for a valid governance transition are:
 - the alias output might be destroyed by the governor (Transaction D),
 - _State Controller Address Unlock Condition_ may be changed,
 - _Governor Address Unlock Condition_ may be changed,
 - _Metadata Feature_ may be changed.

No other fields are allowed to change in the next alias state, therefore a governance transition can't modify token
balances or create foundries.

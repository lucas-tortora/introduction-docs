# Create an Alias

Just like a regular _Basic Output_, an _Alias Output_ also has:
 - _Amount_ to hold base token
 - _Unlock Conditions_ that define how the output can be unlocked
 - _Features_ that don't modify the unlocking.

On top of these, it also defines:
 - _State Index_ that has to be incremented in every transaction initiated by the _State Controller_.
 - _State Metadata_ that may hold binary data,
 - _Foundry Counter_ that defines how many foundries the alias has already created,
 - _Immutable Features_ that are regular _Features_ defined upon creation which can never be modified afterwards.

Alias outputs only support two type of unlock conditions:
 - _State Controller Address Unlock Condition_ that defines the state controller,  and
 - _Governor Address Unlock Condition_ that defines the governor of the alias.

Transaction A shows the process of creating a new alias output and hence an alias account. Notice the creation
constraints enforced by the protocol:
 - _Alias ID_ must be zeroed out. This signals to the protocol that the alias account is new and when the transaction confirms,
a unique _Alias ID_ must be generated.
 - _State Index_ must be zero as this is the first possible state the alias represents.
 - _Foundry Counter_ must be zero as the alias doesn't control any foundries yet.
 - _Issuer_ and _Sender_ addresses must be unlocked in the transaction if present.

When _Alias Output #1_ from Transaction A is consumed in a subsequent transaction, the _Alias ID_ field in the
transitioned alias must be set to the protocol generated unique identifier, which is the Blake2b-256 hash of the
_Output ID_ of _Alias Output #1_.

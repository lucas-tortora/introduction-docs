## State Transition

Transaction B represents a state transition of the alias. As the name suggests, a state transition must be initiated
by the _State Controller_, therefore it is the _stateControllerAddress_ that needs to sign the transaction. During a
state transition, the following constraints need to be met:
 - the alias can't be destroyed,
 - token balances of the output may be changed, the _State Controller_ can transfer funds in- and out of the alias account,
 - _State Index_ must be incremented,
 - _State Metadata_ may be updated,
 - _Foundry Counter_ must be incremented by the number of foundries created in the transaction,
 - _Unlock Conditions_ must not be changed, therefore the state controller can't update ownership of the alias account,
 - _Sender Feature_ may be updated,
 - _Metadata Feature_ must not be updated.

Notice how the _Alias ID_ field has to be set in _Alias Output #2_ to the protocol generated value.

## Burning an NFT

The owner of the NFT may choose to burn it to retrieve the storage deposit of the _NFT Output_. Burning on protocol
level simply means that the _NFT Output_ is unlocked in a transaction, but it doesn't appear on the output side.

Transaction E shows how to burn an NFT and claim its storage deposit into a _Basic Output_.

:::warning
Before burning an NFT, always check whether its _NFT Address_ owns something in the ledger. Otherwise, you may lose those
funds forever!

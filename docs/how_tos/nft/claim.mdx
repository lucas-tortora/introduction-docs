## Claiming a conditional NFT transfer

Transaction D shows how _recipient_ can claim the conditional transfer initiated in Transaction C:
 - _recipient_ has to fund the transaction with the to-be refunded storage deposit, therefore _Basic Output #2_ is unlocked
on the input side.
 - _NFT Output #4_ removes the additional unlocks from the NFT and places it solely into the ownership of _recipient_.
 - _Basic Output #3_ refunds _owner_ with the storage deposit defined in the _Storage Deposit Return Unlock Condition_ of
_NFT Output #3_.
 - Transaction D is only valid if the confirming milestone has a timestamp earlier than the one defined in the
_Expiration Unlock Condition_ of _NFT Output #3_.
 - Since both _NFT Output #3_ and _Basic Output #2_ are unlocked by _recipient_ address, it is enough to sign the transaction
once in _Signature Unlock #1_ and reference this unlock in _Reference Unlock #2_.

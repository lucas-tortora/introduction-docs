# Metadata

Another handy tool is the _Metadata Feature_ of outputs. This feature makes it possible to store arbitrary data in outputs.
Of course, storing data in outputs increases the minimum base token requirement, but in turn it provides a data storage option
that is 24/7 available on any network node.

As soon as the output with metadata is consumed, it is pruned from nodes' databases and base tokens used as storage
deposit are freed up.

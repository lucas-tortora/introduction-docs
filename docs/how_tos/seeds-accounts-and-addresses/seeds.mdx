# Create a Seed

If you want to send any type of [transaction](../output-unlock-conditions/address.mdx), you will need to use
your [seed](#seeds) to generate [accounts](#accounts) and [addresses](#addresses).


## Seeds

You can use a [seed](https://wiki.iota.org/iota.rs/explanations/seeds/) to deterministically generate private keys and
[addresses](#addresses). As the seed is the only key to your accounts and addresses, you should avoid using online
seed generators as these could potentially be used to take control of your accounts.

### Seed Mnemonics or Phrases

The client libraries use the [BIP39 standard](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0039). This means that the libraries can
derive the seed from a mnemonic or seed phrase, making it easier for you to write down or remember. The mnemonic itself
is simply a random list of english words.

The wallet.rs library is secured by [Stronghold](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/stronghold/welcome) by default. This
means that you can simply create an `AccountManager` instance, and Stronghold will generate and store your seed securely.

You can still use the library to generate a mnemonic by calling the `AccountManager.generateMnemonic()` function.

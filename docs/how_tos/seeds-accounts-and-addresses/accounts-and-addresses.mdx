# Accounts and Addresses

Since the Chrysalis protocol, addresses in the IOTA ecosystem are reusable. This means you map them to your
users in a clear and concise way. You can use your [seed](seeds.mdx) to generate any number of accounts. You create
one [account for each user](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/wallet.rs/explanations/account_approaches/#single-account-approach)
or [use a single account and generate multiple addresses](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/wallet.rs/explanations/account_approaches/#single-account-approach),
which you can then link to the users in your database.

## Accounts

Accounts are related to a specific [IOTA Layer 1 Network](#todo-add-link). You can create as many accounts as you want
per seed, and then use those accounts to generate as many addresses as you want.

## Addresses

The client libraries use the [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) method to generate
addresses as [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519) key pairs generated that follow the
[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) logical hierarchy.
